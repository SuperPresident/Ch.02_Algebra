HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: ____Darius___

1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
Using the #


2.) What do the following lines of code output? ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
2 / 3  =0.6666666666666666

2 // 3 =0 #because it floors the numbers after the decimal
3/2  =1.5
3//2 =1   #because it floors the numbers after the decimal


INCORRECT! Try this code. It won't work! why?
3.) What happens when you try this and why?
A = 22
b = 13
c = a+b
 error #because little a wasnt defined



4.) All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is the better variable name to use?
a
A
Area
AREA
area
area_of_rectangle #this is the best one because its consistent lowercase and easier to read
Area_Of_Rectangle





5.) Which of these variables names are NOT allowed in Python? 
Test them if you aren't sure.

apple
Apple
APPLE
Apple2
1Apple #has to start with letter or underscore
account number #needs underscore
account_number
account.number #needs underscore instead of period
accountNumber
account#
pi
PI
fred
Fred
GreatBigVariable
greatBigVariable
great_big_variable
great.big.variable #needs underscores instead of period
2x #has to start with letter or underscore
x2x
total% #cant be a variable because the percentage sign
#left #hashtag makes it a comment






6.) Predict the output of (a) and its type and then test it?
a =2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a
type(a)
#output of a is 15
#type is float number is 15.0






7.) This program runs, but the code still could be better. How?
radius = 10
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi  * radius ** 2
area
#area= 314.0

radius=10
radius**=2
pi=3.14
area=radius*pi
area


8.) What is the ouput of each of these?
type(42) #int
type(42.0) #float
type("C3PO") #string
type(True) #bool







9.) Fix the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3*(x + y)
a
a=3*(3+y)




10.)Why does this code not calculate the average?
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = (x+y+z)/3
ave
